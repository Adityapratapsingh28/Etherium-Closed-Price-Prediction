# Etherium Price Predictor
This is a Machine learning model that uses past Etherium coin dataset like opening price , high price , low price in order to predict the closing price of Etherium.Linear Regression Algorithm that is a Regression Algorithm is used to train tha data and then test upon various testing samples.
For the frontend simple html and css is used in order to take the input from the user.
For connecting the ML model to the webpage flask framework is used in order to pass the input from the webpage to the model.

## Algorithm used
- Linear Regression
## Technology used
- Python
- Pandas (for data reading and manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for traning testing and operation on data)
- flask (for connecting ml model to webpage)
- html css - (for making the interface page)

### Backend : Simple flask application for prediction
The Backend is simple flask application that uses pre trained ML model that process the input and give the prediction.

### Frontend : html Css page
The Frontend is made using simple html and css , that takes 3 inputs - Etherium opening , high & low price and return the closing price for today.

## Project Structure
### Backend (Flask)
- app.py : Conatins flask code for etherium price prediction.
- model.py : Conatins the ML model trained with linear Regression algorithm.
### Frontend (html css)
- web.html : Main component and structure for the page.
- style.css : for styling the components.
